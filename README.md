# Express API Project
API with Top music data where we created different endpoint with the help of express.js.

The endpoints available are: 
https://top-music-data.herokuapp.com/endpoints

    "path": "/",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
      
    "path": "/music/id/:id",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
      
     "path": "/music/artists/:artist",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
      
    "path": "/music/track/:track",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
      
    "path": "/music/genre/:genre",
    "methods": [
      "GET"

## The problem

Used postman to easier look at my data and endpoints. As usual VS code and deployed at heroku.
